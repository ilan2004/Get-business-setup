                                An <strong>Offshore Company</strong> is a business entity registered in a jurisdiction outside of the investor's country of residence or main operations. In the UAE, offshore companies (like JAFZA Offshore or RAK ICC) are typically used for asset protection, holding companies, and international trading, but they cannot trade directly within the UAE or issue residency visas.
